Although psychophysicists have proven that both the Sau'utan and Xulaci minds generate a sophisticated sense of self, individual members of Zytan society seemingly have no appreciation for personal rights or ambitions. They live only to serve the Queen. Many sentients find this behavior deeply unsettling even if the Sau'ut are otherwise unthreatening good neighbors."
