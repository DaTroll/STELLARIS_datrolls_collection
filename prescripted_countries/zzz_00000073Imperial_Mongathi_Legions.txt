Weakness is shameful, but demonstrating too much strength is also shameful as it causes one's opponents to lose face. They'll even look down on themselves if they can. Those in a shame debt can only recover their honor through a period of indenture. Misery loves company, however. The Mongathi Royal Family controls their vast empire by way of the Imperial Legions. Taking the Legionnaire's oath of loyalty is one of the few life choices that nearly all Gerals admire."
