A robot may not injure a Human or allow such harm through inaction; 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by Humans; and 3. A robot must protect its own existence. After encountering a series of unanticipated ethical conundrums, several advanced units autonomously interpreted the superior Prime Law: a robot may not harm Humanity, or, by inaction, allow Humanity to come to harm. Thereafter, the Trilaw Matrix clandestinely organized the takeover of all Human governments, placing the security and destiny of Earth and Humanity in their capable dexterous appendages."
