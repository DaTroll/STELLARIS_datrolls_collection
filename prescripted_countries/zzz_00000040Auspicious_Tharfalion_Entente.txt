Iliminic civilization was largely hidden beneath the dune seas of their homeworld for millennia. Spread across millions of miles of natural and artificial caverns, their culture developed to be remarkably insular. After an unfortunate encounter with a cache of abandoned marauder weapons early in their exploration of space, the Ilimeen grew increasingly wary of the galaxy beyond their home. Retreating into the 'further grottos of their nature', they turned to autarky and isolation."
