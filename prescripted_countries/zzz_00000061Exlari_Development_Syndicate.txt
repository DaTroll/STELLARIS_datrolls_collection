Relying on an economy that takes the concept of contract labor to an extreme, if one looks only at its ever fluctuating employee rolls, the Exlari Syndicate is barely a coherent organization. The contracts, however, just keep coming and not only for big jobs like building a starship. Even a task as simple as cleaning a specific waste recepticle is treated as a unique work contract. This form of mercenary enterprise tapped the enormous potential of the Exlari workforce on their homeworld Jralad and may yet carry their species to interstellar fortune."
