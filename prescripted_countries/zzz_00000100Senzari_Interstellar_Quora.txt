Exceptionally long-lived, individual Ta'lulans usually go through several distinct decades-long phases of life, including periods of extended isolation during which they hone their meditative practices. Another peculiar element of their biology is a years-long reproductive cycle. Though abhoring the use of violence to achieve their ends, if provoked, one should expect the Ta'lulans to bring cutting edge tech to bear against their enemies."
