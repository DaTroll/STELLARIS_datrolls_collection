The United Earth Federation was the result. An exclusive democracy, the Federation extends the franchise only to those who have put their lives on the line in its defense. Civilians who complete a term of Federal service earn citizenship and the right to participate in politics. Although the government is administered by the Federal Council, the Sky Marshal, elected from among the military's most senior and decorated career officers, controls Federal forces in most interstellar affairs."
