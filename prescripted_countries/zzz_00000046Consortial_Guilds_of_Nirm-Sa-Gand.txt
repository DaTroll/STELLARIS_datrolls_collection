The Mirdhese inherited many of their traits from evolutionary ancestors, a species of horde-building insects that once roamed the crags and crevices of Nirm-Sa-Gand by night. Overseeing a vast blended capitalist market, their Consortium exercises control only when necessary to ensure the flow of commerce and economic growth."
