Though most of them are impressive to behold in personal combat, martial skill does not in itself equate to power in Felyrish society. Indeed their High Kings and Queens are elected by the Ducal Congress primarily on the sophistication of their poetry, their acrobatic talents, and ability to play the lacera, a musical instrument operated by scratching."
